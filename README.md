# CS350

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:
One project involved building a button-controlled LED system that could handle user input without blocking other tasks. Another integrated a temperature and humidity sensor with a 16x2 LCD to show live data. Both projects focused on connecting hardware and software, solving the challenge of making embedded devices respond accurately to user input and environmental data.

What did you do particularly well?
I designed my code to handle asynchronous tasks smoothly by using threads and modular functions. I also wrote clear wiring documentation so that others can follow the hardware setup easily.

Where could you improve?
I could add more robust error handling and unit tests to catch communication issues with the sensor earlier. Automating more of the testing process would also make debugging faster.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I learned to use the Raspberry Pi GPIO libraries, I²C documentation, and hardware datasheets. I also gained experience using online resources and forums for troubleshooting embedded system challenges.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
These projects strengthened my skills in hardware–software interfacing, concurrency, modular program design, and debugging. They are highly applicable to future embedded systems and IoT projects.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used clear naming conventions, separated code into reusable modules, and included comments and setup documentation. This makes the project easier to update or extend for future use.
